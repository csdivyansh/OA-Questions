Problem Statement: A cloud storage service provider is developing a system that helps users synchronize files across multiple devices. One major challenge in file synchronization is resolving differences between two versions of a file that may have been edited independently on different devices. These differences often appear in the form of mismatched strings in text-based data — such as configuration files, code, or plain text documents.
To intelligently merge these file versions, the system must determine the minimal changes needed to make the two strings identical while incurring the least "cost." In this context, each character has an associated cost of deletion equal to its ASCII value. The goal is to remove characters from each string such that the resulting strings become equal and the total ASCII sum of all deleted characters is minimized.
For example:
If s1 = "sea" and s2 = "eat", you could delete 's' from s1 (ASCII 115) and 't' from s2 (ASCII 116) to make both equal to "ea", with a total cost of 231.


You are tasked with implementing the core logic of this reconciliation process. Given two strings s1 and s2, return the lowest possible ASCII sum of characters that must be deleted from the strings to make them equal.
This program will be critical in the file comparison engine, where minimizing data loss and sync time is essential. The implementation must be efficient, as it may be called thousands of times across different parts of a distributed system.
This assessment challenges the candidate’s understanding of dynamic programming, optimization under constraints, and practical applications in file and data synchronization.

Constraints:
1 <= s1.length, s2.length <= 1000
s1 and s2 consist of lowercase English letters.

Example 1:
Input: s1 = "sea", s2 = "eat"
Output: 231
Explanation: Deleting "s" from "sea" adds the ASCII value of "s" (115) to the sum. 
Deleting "t" from "eat" adds 116 to the sum.
At the end, both strings are equal, and 115 + 116 = 231 is the minimum sum possible to achieve this.

Example 2:
Input: s1 = "delete", s2 = "leet"
Output: 403
Explanation: Deleting "dee" from "delete" to turn the string into "let",
adds 100[d] + 101[e] + 101[e] to the sum.
Deleting "e" from "leet" adds 101[e] to the sum.
At the end, both strings are equal to "let", and the answer is 100+101+101+101 = 403.
If instead we turned both strings into "lee" or "eet", we would get answers of 433 or 417, which are higher.
