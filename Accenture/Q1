Problem Statement: You work as a software engineer for a logistics company that manages warehouse inventory and shipping. Each warehouse stores multiple products, and the company needs a quick way to analyze the combined shipment potential of all products excluding a particular one.
Given an array nums where each element represents the quantity of a specific product in the warehouse, your task is to create a function that computes a new array answer. For each product at index i, answer[i] should be the total shipment capacity considering all other products except the one at index i. In other words, answer[i] is the product of the quantities of all products except nums[i].
This calculation helps the company evaluate how the removal of any single product affects the overall shipping capacity. The algorithm must be efficient, running in linear time, and should avoid using division operations due to potential zero quantities and precision constraints.
Constraints:
2 <= nums.length <= 10^5
-30 <= nums[i] <= 30
The input is generated such that answer[i] is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [24,12,8,6]

Example 2:
Input: nums = [-1,1,0,-3,3]
Output: [0,0,9,0,0]

Input0:
1 1 2 3
Output0:
6 6 3 2
Input1:
1 1 2 3 0
Output1:
0 0 0 0 6
Input2:
-1 -1 2 -3
Output2:
6 6 -3 2
Input3:
-1 -1 2 -3 -1
Output3:
-6 -6 3 -2 -6
Input4:
1 5 4 3
Output4:
60 12 15 20
Input5:
1 2 3 7 10
Output5:
420 210 140 60 42
