Problem Statement:  
In the mystical kingdom of Palindoria, a grand library holds an ancient collection of enchanted scrolls. Each scroll contains a unique word, written in a magical language. The kingdom’s wizard, Aric, has uncovered a powerful spell—when two scrolls are placed side by side, they may form a   palindromic incantation  . A   palindrome   is a sequence that reads the same forward and backward.  

The king has ordered Aric to find all possible   pairs of scrolls   that can be combined to form a palindrome. However, there are strict rules:  
1. A scroll cannot be paired with itself.  
2. Each scroll can only be used   as is  , without rearranging the letters.  
3. Aric must find the pairs   as quickly as possible  , for the spell’s power fades with time.  

Aric seeks the help of the kingdom’s greatest minds to solve this challenge efficiently. Given a   list of scrolls (words)  , can you help him find all valid   palindrome pairs  ? The fate of Palindoria’s magic depends on your solution!  

 Constraints:    
    1 ≤ words.length ≤ 10⁴    
    1 ≤ words[i].length ≤ 1000    
     Each word is   unique    

Find the pairs of indices where the words form palindromes when combined!

Example 1 : 
Input: words:
 pqrs srqp lls s sssll
Output: 
[0,1] [1,0] [3,2] [2,4]
Explanation: 
The palindromes are ["pqrssrqp","srqppqrs","slls","llssssll"]

Input0:
hat tah cat
Output0:
 [0 1] [1 0]
Input1:
bat tab app p pp
Output1:
 [0 1] [1 0] [4 2] [4 3] [3 4]
Input2:
bat tab app
Output2:
 [0 1] [1 0]
Input3:
 a  ba
Output3:
 [0 1]
