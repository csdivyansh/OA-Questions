Problem Statement: In a digital library system, books are categorized and arranged in a hierarchical structure based on genres, sub-genres, and specific topics. Each node in this structure represents a category, and it may have a left and right subcategory. The library administrators use a binary tree to represent this hierarchy, where each node stores a category name and pointers to its left and right child categories.
To improve user experience, the system needs to display all available categories in a logically sorted sequence. The sequence should ensure that users can explore subcategories of a genre before and after visiting a central category — similar to how books are ordered in physical libraries, with side topics and then main topics followed by related ones.
The software engineering team has determined that performing an in-order traversal of the binary category tree will achieve this objective. During in-order traversal, the system visits the left child (subcategory), then the current node (category), and finally the right child (another subcategory). This ensures a natural and hierarchical reading flow through the digital catalog.
Your task is to implement a function that, given the root node of the category tree, returns the in-order traversal of all the categories. This will help the library interface display them in a user-friendly and logical sequence. The returned order will be used by the frontend interface to present categories from left-most sub-genres to right-most, passing through their parent genres in an intuitive browsing path.
This task will assess your understanding of binary tree traversal, recursive logic, and the ability to apply data structures to practical, user-facing software systems in a meaningful way.
