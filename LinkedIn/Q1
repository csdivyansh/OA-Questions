Problem Statement: A warehouse management system uses string identifiers to represent the layout of products on shelves. Each character in a string represents a unique product, and its position in the string denotes its physical placement on a shelf (from left to right). For example, the string s = "ABCD" means product A is on the first position, B on the second, and so on.
Due to operational needs, the warehouse occasionally reorganizes the shelf layout. After such an event, the new layout is recorded as another string t, which is a permutation of the original layout s (all products are still present, just rearranged).
Reorganizing shelves comes with a cost — the farther a product is moved from its original position, the more effort and time it requires. To quantify this, the warehouse calculates a "reorganization cost" as the sum of the absolute differences between each product's original index in s and its new index in t.
Your task is to write a function that computes the total reorganization cost given the original layout s and the new layout t. This calculation will help optimize future reorganizations and allocate labor resources more effectively.
Constraints:
1 <= s.length <= 26
Each character occurs at most once in s.
t is a permutation of s.
s consists only of lowercase English letters.

Example 1:
Input: s = "abc", t = "bac"
Output: 2
Explanation:
For s = "abc" and t = "bac", the permutation difference of s and t is equal to the sum of:
The absolute difference between the index of the occurrence of "a" in s and the index of the occurrence of "a" in t.
The absolute difference between the index of the occurrence of "b" in s and the index of the occurrence of "b" in t.
The absolute difference between the index of the occurrence of "c" in s and the index of the occurrence of "c" in t.
That is, the permutation difference between s and t is equal to |0 - 1| + |1 - 0| + |2 - 2| = 2.

Example 2:
Input: s = "abcde", t = "edbac"
Output: 12
Explanation: The permutation difference between s and t is equal to |0 - 3| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 4| + |3 - 1| + |4 - 0| = 12.
