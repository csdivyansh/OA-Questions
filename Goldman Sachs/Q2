Goldman Sach OA Question 🔥🔥 Hard
Topic: Challenge


Problem Statement: You have been hired as a systems analyst for an amusement park to help optimize customer flow at their ticket counters. At one of the busiest booths, customers line up to buy ride tickets under the following rules:
Each customer is allowed to buy only one ticket at a time.
After purchasing a ticket, if a customer still needs more, they are required to instantly move to the end of the line and wait their turn again.
Each ticket purchase takes exactly 1 second.
Once a customer buys all the tickets they need, they leave the queue and do not return.
You are given a queue of n people. The queue is represented by an integer array tickets of length n, where tickets[i] is the number of tickets the person at position i initially wants to purchase. The person at index 0 is at the front of the line, and the person at index n - 1 is at the back.
Your task is to calculate how long it will take for the person at position k (0-indexed) to finish purchasing all their tickets and leave the line.
If tickets = [2, 3, 2] and k = 2, the person at index 2 will:
Buy a ticket at second 1 (tickets remaining: 1).
Return to the back and buy again at second 4.
Finish buying and exit at second 6.
Write a program that takes the tickets array and an integer k representing the target person’s position, and returns the total time (in seconds) it will take for that person to complete their ticket purchases. Optimize your solution for efficiency and explain your reasoning clearly.

Constraints:
n == tickets.length
1 <= n <= 100
1 <= tickets[i] <= 100
0 <= k < n

Example 1:
Input: tickets = [2,3,2], k = 2
Output: 6
Explanation:
The queue starts as [2,3,2], where the kth person is underlined.
After the person at the front has bought a ticket, the queue becomes [3,2,1] at 1 second.
Continuing this process, the queue becomes [2,1,2] at 2 seconds.
Continuing this process, the queue becomes [1,2,1] at 3 seconds.
Continuing this process, the queue becomes [2,1] at 4 seconds. Note: the person at the front left the queue.
Continuing this process, the queue becomes [1,1] at 5 seconds.
Continuing this process, the queue becomes [1] at 6 seconds. The kth person has bought all their tickets, so return 6.

Example 2:
Input: tickets = [5,1,1,1], k = 0
Output: 8
Explanation:
The queue starts as [5,1,1,1], where the kth person is underlined.
After the person at the front has bought a ticket, the queue becomes [1,1,1,4] at 1 second.
Continuing this process for 3 seconds, the queue becomes [4] at 4 seconds.
Continuing this process for 4 seconds, the queue becomes [] at 8 seconds. The kth person has bought all their tickets, so return 8.
